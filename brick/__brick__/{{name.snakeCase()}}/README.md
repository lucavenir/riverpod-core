## Usage üíØ

*** warning ***
PLEASE VISIT https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/kotlin-version TO MIGRATE TO THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF KOTLIN
BECAUSE OF A KNOWN ISSUE, SOME PACKAGES CONFLICT AND REQUIRE kotlin version >= 1.8.10
*** end-of-warning ***

For a clean run, remember, use:

```sh
flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

{{#anyCodegen}}
This project exploits code generation extensively.  
Before anything, you need to run `build_runner` at least once before launching this application:

```sh
dart run build_runner build -d
```

Wait until this process is done. It can even take a few minutes.

### Supported platforms
This application currently supports the following platform{{#isCrossPlatform}}s{{/isCrossPlatform}}: {{formattedPlatforms}}.

### Dev server

{{#flavorizr}}
Since this application uses [flavors][flavors-link], you can't just use 'flutter run`.  
When you're ready to see this application in action (debug mode), you can run:

{{flavors}}
```sh
# Development flavor
$ flutter run --flavor {{.}} --target lib/main_{{.snakeCase()}}.dart
```
{{/flavors}}

{{/flavorizr}}

...And look at this software go!

### Build

Building an application can be done through `flutter build`, but it's recommended to set up a CI/CD tool before releasing a staging or a production-ready executable.

### Architecture
This project uses [well-known Clean Architecture][clean-arch-link] principles, with
[a pinch of pragmatism][clean-arch-riverpod-repo-example-link].

### Libraries
Here's a quick recap of the libraries used in this project:
  - {{^hooks}}`riverpod`{{/hooks}}{{#hooks}}`hooks_riverpod`{{/hooks}} as state management / caching / DI solution
{{#codegen}}  - `riverpod_generator` to supercharge `riverpod`{{/codegen}}
{{#freezed}}  - `freezed` to generate data classes{{/freezed}}.  
{{#hooks}}  - `flutter_hooks` to easily handle ephimeral state{{/hooks}}
  - `riverpod_lint` for a set of great riverpod-related lints
{{#very_good_analysis}}  - `very_good_analysis` for a set of well-known lints{{/very_good_analysis}}

## Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "New Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:{{name.snakeCase()}}/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.
